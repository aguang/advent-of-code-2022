Learning Rust brand-new, have never written a single line in it before.

## Reflections

I learned a bit too much to summarize here considering I was starting from having never done Rust at all. Instead, every day's README has bullet points of what I learned for that day's problem. But all-in-all it is a very fun and fast language after the beginning somewhat-steep learning curve, I'm glad I have data structure and pointer/reference/memory address experience from undergrad. I think it will become my language of choice for data processing tasks in the future while sticking to R for visualizations, data frame manipulations, and reports. Although maybe there will be a different language from R one day that I will prefer for secondary analysis, for now I just haven't found anything better than the RStudio/tidyverse/stats packages combination.

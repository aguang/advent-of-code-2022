Solutions are in Julia to brush up on and strengthen my Julia proficiency. Maybe I'll start using it for some real data science projects in the new year! Occasionally I've benchmarked multiple solutions to check my intuition on which one is faster. Those are shown in the table below.

| Day | Solution | Benchmark |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | If else statements to check top 3 and saving only those values | 132.917 μs |
| 1 | Array with all sums, sort, get top 3 | 149.583 μs |
